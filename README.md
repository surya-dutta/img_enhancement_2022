# capstone-project"# img_enhancement_2022" 

Devised an ISP pipeline using a novel Channel-Prior-based Retinex algorithm in Python to enhance low-quality underwater images and minimized detail loss, and improved image visual quality by roughly 40% when compared to other standard image enhancement algorithms. Implemented color correction and Dark Channel Prior (DCP/UDCP) algorithms using OpenCV and Python on the luminance layer of given low-quality underwater images, and incorporated this onto a multi-scale Retinex model. Eliminated the halo effect and preserved the dynamic range and contrast of the images. Published findings as a conference paper in the 2022 IEEE Second International Conference on Advances in Electrical, Computing, Communications and Sustainable Technologies (ICAECT 2022), India.
